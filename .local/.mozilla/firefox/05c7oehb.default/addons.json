Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":2147,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6629,"reviewCount":350,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1742562897000},{"id":"CookieAutoDelete@kennydo.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/784/784287-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/784/784287-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/784/784287-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Cookie AutoDelete","version":"3.8.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4040738/cookie_autodelete-3.8.2.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete","supportURL":"https://github.com/Cookie-AutoDelete/Cookie-AutoDelete/issues","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/","description":"Control your cookies! This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Keep the ones you trust (forever/until restart) while deleting the rest. Containers Supported","fullDescription":"Please don't use reviews for bugs, support request, or feature requests. Use GitHub instead.\n\nAs of Firefox 86, strict mode is not supported at this time due to missing APIs to handle the Total Cookie Protection. Also as of Firefox 103, standard mode has also enabled Total Cookie Protection. Use 'strict' mode if using pre-86, use standard mode for versions 86-102, or from version 103+ use the custom configuration and set cookie to 'cross site tracking cookies' option (not the cross-site cookies).\n\nBefore opening a GitHub Issue, please check the troubleshooting FAQ first. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies and other site data for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete site data by domains.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: This setting has been removed since 3.4.0 and is kept here for historical reasons. Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed (and/or discarded) Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for domains\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist and core settings\n- Clear All Cookies and site data for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\n- Cleaning site data other than cookies within containers will have unintended side effects due to the current Web Extension API where attempting to clear a site data for one domain on a container will also clear that site data of the same domain on all containers.\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":1774,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"CAD Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1622132671","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1622132671","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.jpg?modified=1622132671","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://liberapay.com/CAD_Developers/?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.5428,"reviewCount":668,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1670829069000},{"id":"firefox-extension@deepl.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2804/2804910-32.png?modified=0a0e3fbf","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2804/2804910-64.png?modified=0a0e3fbf","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2804/2804910-128.png?modified=0a0e3fbf"},"name":"DeepL: AI translator and writing assistant","version":"1.44.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4482510/deepl_translate-1.44.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://deepl.com","supportURL":"https://deepl.com","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/deepl-translate/","description":"Stay informed, work smarter, and communicate globally without leaving your browser.","fullDescription":"Trusted by millions across the globe, DeepL’s Language AI delivers unmatched accuracy and fluency to help you scale faster and bring clarity and efficiency into your daily work.
